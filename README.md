## About Me ![alt](http://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5635AQEZKtwn_zUJWw/profile-framedphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1604853542631?e=1606064400&v=beta&t=4AxcXPIZao5Bwt-rr5F79gKUD42Cs0RoDi0k_wad8To)
Junior Software Tester looking for opportunities to work onsite or remotely as a manual tester or in test automation using Selenium. Though the market is not easy now for new joiners due to the pandemic outbreak, I hope I'll be given a chance to prove how eager to learn I really am :) I already took the first step towards becoming a tester by taking part in "Software Tester" course at Software Development Academy, which was great - I've learned there a lot. While looking for opportunities, I'm continually improving my skills in Selenium and SQL under the supervision of an experienced software developer.
